## YOUR BLOG POST

Headline: See auth rate dips as they happen

Subheading (optional): Introducing Real‑Time Acceptance Insights for Stripe Payments

---

### [Opening hook]

Payments issues rarely announce themselves. A tiny drop in card approvals can snowball into lost revenue before anyone notices. Now you can spot—and fix—auth problems in minutes, not days.

### [First Main Point]

**What it does**

Real‑Time Acceptance Insights streams issuer, network, and method‑level authorization metrics within minutes. Slice by country, BIN, wallet, 3DS, and network tokens to pinpoint where approvals slipped.

Key takeaway: You get immediate visibility into failure patterns—down to issuer and method—so you can respond fast.

### [Second Main Point]

**Why we built it**

Merchants told us weekly dashboards arrive too late to prevent revenue loss. If approvals drop during a marketing push or issuer outage, they need signal now—not in next week’s report.

Key takeaway: Faster signal → quicker playbooks (route, retry, or switch SCA) → protected revenue.

### [Third Main Point if needed]

**How it works**

- Fresh metrics every few minutes in the Dashboard and API.
- Prebuilt filters for BIN, issuer, country, wallet, 3DS, network tokens.
- One‑click recommendations (e.g., enable network tokens on cards with high PAN‑declines).
- Alerting: set thresholds for approval rate deltas by market or issuer.

### Conclusion

With near‑real‑time visibility, you can route traffic smarter, enable the right safeguards, and fix the exact links in the chain that break.

What to do next:
Turn it on in **Payments > Insights** or via API. Connect Alerts to Slack so your on‑call team sees changes within minutes.
