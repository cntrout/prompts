## YOUR BLOG POST

Headline: How to cut chargebacks ~30% in 30 days

Subheading (optional): A practical Radar playbook for SaaS and subscriptions

---

### [Opening hook]

Chargebacks hurt twice—lost revenue and extra ops work. The good news: a handful of Radar settings and workflow tweaks can meaningfully reduce disputes in weeks.

### [First Main Point]

**Step 1: Turn on the right Radar defaults**

- Enable **Adaptive Authentication** to challenge only risky payments.
- Use the **Safe List** for trusted customers (e.g., long‑tenured subscribers).
- Block obvious fraud patterns (new device + high amount + mismatched country).

Key takeaway: Start with high‑signal controls that don’t dent conversion.

### [Second Main Point]

**Step 2: Tighten your evidence and refunds workflow**

- Respond to disputes within 5–7 days with screenshots, usage logs, and ToS.
- Auto‑refund legitimate cancels before they file disputes.
- Add clear billing descriptors and receipts with support links.

Key takeaway: Good ops cut “friendly fraud” before it becomes a dispute.

### [Third Main Point if needed]

**Step 3: Monitor risk cohorts**

- Track disputes by BIN, country, device fingerprint, and trial plans.
- Add lightweight KYC (email + phone + IP risk) on promo‑heavy plans.
- Review high‑risk cohorts weekly; adjust Radar rules accordingly.

### Conclusion

Most teams see a 20–35% reduction by pairing a few smart rules with better evidence hygiene.

What to do next:
Open **Radar > Settings** and mirror this checklist. Add two weekly dashboards: **Dispute rate by plan** and **Dispute outcomes by evidence type**.
