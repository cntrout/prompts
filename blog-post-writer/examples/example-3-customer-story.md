## YOUR BLOG POST

Headline: How QuickCart lifted auth rates by 2.4 pp

Subheading (optional): A network tokenization story across issuers and wallets

---

### [Opening hook]

QuickCart processes millions of SaaS renewals a month. Expired PANs and reissued cards tanked approvals—until they turned on network tokens.

### [First Main Point]

**The challenge**

Recurring payments failed after card reissues and expirations, creating churn and support load. Traditional PAN updates lagged and didn’t cover all wallets.

Key takeaway: Expired cards and reissues quietly erode renewal revenue.

### [Second Main Point]

**The solution**

Enabled **network tokens** across major issuers and wallets. Paired with dunning updates and soft retries timed to issuer windows.

Key takeaway: Tokens maintain continuity across card life‑cycle events.

### [Third Main Point if needed]

**The results**

- +2.4 percentage points in authorization rate on renewals.
- 14% fewer support tickets about failed payments.
- Faster recovery after issuer portfolio updates.

### Conclusion

Tokens plus smarter retries stabilized renewals and reduced churn—without extra friction for customers.

What to do next:
Check **Payments > Settings > Network tokens** and roll out to renewal traffic first. Add a dashboard panel: **Auth rate — tokenized vs PAN**.
