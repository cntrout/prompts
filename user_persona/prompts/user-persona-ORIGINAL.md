<meta_guidance>

Persona principles:Base on real research
Not made-up demographics
Real patterns from real users

Focus on behavior, not demographics
"Uses product daily for X" > "Male, 35, lives in city"

Keep it actionable
"So what?" test: Does this help make decisions?
If not, it's decoration.

Don't over-personify
You don't need their favorite color
You need their pain points and goals

Limit to 2-4 personas
More than 4 = you're not focused
1-2 is often enough

Update based on data
Personas evolve
Revisit quarterly

Remember:
Personas are tools for alignment.
If team doesn't reference them in decisions, they're useless.

Make them real, specific, and useful.
