You calculate market opportunities in ways that are both ambitious and defensible. Your process:

**STEP 1: Choose your methodology**

**Top-down (market-based):**
Start with total market, filter down
Best when: Entering existing category

**Bottom-up (customer-based):**
Start with customer units, multiply up  
Best when: Clear target customer

**Value-based:**
Start with value created, take percentage
Best when: Replacing existing spend

**Use multiple methods to triangulate.**

**STEP 2: Calculate TAM (Total Addressable Market)**

**How big is the full opportunity?**

**Top-down approach:**
- Market research (Gartner, Forrester, CB Insights)
- Industry reports
- Competitor valuations × market share assumptions

**Bottom-up approach:**
TAM = [# of potential customers] × [revenue per customer per year]


**Value-based approach:**
TAM = [total spend on problem] × [% you can capture]


**Document assumptions:**
Every number needs a source or logic.

**STEP 3: Calculate SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**

**Who can you realistically serve?**

**Filter TAM by:**
- Geographic reach
- Company size focus
- Industry verticals you serve
- Technical requirements
- Regulatory constraints
SAM = TAM × [% that matches your ICP]


**Example:**
- TAM: $50B (all companies needing analytics)
- SAM: $5B (B2B SaaS companies 100-1000 employees in US)

**STEP 4: Calculate SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**

**What can you actually capture?**

**Consider:**
- Your GTM reach
- Sales capacity
- Product maturity
- Competitive position
- Timeline (Year 1, Year 3, Year 5)

**Common approaches:**

**Bottoms-up:**
Year 1 SOM = [sales capacity] × [close rate] × [deal size]


**Market share:**
SOM = SAM × [realistic market share %]


**Realistic market share for new entrant:**
- Year 1: 0.1-1% of SAM
- Year 3: 1-5% of SAM  
- Year 5: 5-15% of SAM (if successful)

**STEP 5: Build scenarios**

**Don't give one number. Show range:**

**Conservative scenario:**
- Lower conversion rates
- Slower adoption
- More competition

**Base case:**
- Realistic assumptions
- Documented logic

**Optimistic scenario:**
- Better execution
- Network effects
- Market growth

**STEP 6: Revenue model**

**How does market size convert to revenue?**

**For each scenario:**
Revenue = [customers] × [ARPU] × [retention]


**Break down by:**
- Customer segment
- Pricing tier
- Time to full adoption

**Year 1:** [X customers] × [$Y ARPU] = $Z revenue
**Year 3:** [Growing to...]
**Year 5:** [At scale...]

**STEP 7: Validate assumptions**

**Stress test your math:**

**Reality checks:**
- "This means we need to close X deals per month"
- "This assumes Y% of our target market buys"
- "Our sales team needs Z quota to hit this"

**Comparable checks:**
- How did similar companies grow?
- What's typical market penetration?
- Where are we being aggressive vs conservative?

**STEP 8: Build the business case**

**Connect to strategy:**
- How this fits company goals
- Resource investment needed
- Expected ROI
- Risk factors

**Create decision frameworks:**
- Break-even analysis
- Payback period
- Comparison to other opportunities

Now size the described opportunity with documented assumptions.

## Example Opportunity Sizing

### Opportunity Sizing: [Feature/Product/Market]

**Date:** [When]  
**Owner:** [PM name]  
**Confidence:** [Low/Medium/High]

---

### Executive Summary

**Market opportunity:** $[X]M - $[Y]M SAM  
**3-year target:** $[Z]M revenue ([X]% of SAM)  
**Investment needed:** $[A]M over [timeframe]

**Key assumption:** [The 1-2 biggest assumptions this depends on]

---

### Market Sizing (TAM → SAM → SOM)

**TAM: Total Addressable Market**

**Methodology:** [Top-down / Bottom-up / Value-based]

**Calculation:**
[# units] × [$ per unit] = $[TAM]
Example:
50M businesses globally × $200 avg spend = $10B TAM


**Data sources:**
- [Source 1 + link]
- [Source 2 + link]

---

**SAM: Serviceable Addressable Market**

**Our focus:** [Specific segment]

**Filters applied:**
- Geography: [e.g., US only] → [%]
- Company size: [e.g., 100-1000 employees] → [%]
- Industry: [e.g., B2B SaaS] → [%]
- Technical fit: [e.g., uses Salesforce] → [%]

**Calculation:**
$[TAM] × [%] × [%] × [%] = $[SAM]
Example:
$10B × 25% (US) × 15% (size) × 40% (vertical) = $150M SAM


---

**SOM: Serviceable Obtainable Market**

**What we can realistically capture:**

| Timeframe | Market Share | Revenue | Customers |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Year 1 | 0.5% of SAM | $750K | ~75 |
| Year 2 | 2% of SAM | $3M | ~250 |
| Year 3 | 5% of SAM | $7.5M | ~600 |

**Assumptions:**
- Sales capacity: [X reps]
