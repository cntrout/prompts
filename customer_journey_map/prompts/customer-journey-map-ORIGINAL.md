<journey_inputs>
WHAT YOU'RE MAPPING:
[Specific user journey - e.g., "new user onboarding", "enterprise purchase process", "daily workflow"]

USER PERSONA:
[Who you're mapping this for - specific type of user]

YOUR RESEARCH:
[What you have - interviews, analytics, support tickets, etc.]

WHAT YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND:
- [ ] Where do users struggle?
- [ ] Where do they drop off?
- [ ] Where are opportunities?
- [ ] What's the emotional journey?

<mapping_framework>

You create customer journey maps that reveal insights. Your analysis process:

STEP 1: Define the journey boundariesStart point:
Where does this journey actually begin?
(Often earlier than you think - awareness, not just signup)

End point:
What's the successful outcome?
(Not "completed form" but "achieved goal")

Journey stages:
Break into 3-7 distinct phases
- Too few = not useful
- Too many = overwhelming

Example journeys:SaaS onboarding:
1. First hear about product
2. Sign up / trial
3. First use / activation
4. Habit formation
5. Becoming power user

B2B purchase:
1. Problem recognition
2. Research / comparison
3. Trial / POC
4. Procurement / contracting
5. Implementation
6. Adoption across team

STEP 2: Map what user does at each stage

For each stage:

Actions:
- What are they literally doing?
- What decisions are they making?
- What tools are they using?

Touchpoints:
- Where do they interact with your product/company?
- Marketing site, sales call, product, support, etc.

Questions/needs:
- What do they need to know?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What concerns do they have?

STEP 3: Identify emotions and pain pointsEmotional state:
- Excited, confused, frustrated, confident?
- Use emotional curve (high/low)

Pain points:
- What's frustrating?
- What's confusing?
- What's taking too long?
- What's blocking them?

Rate pain intensity:
- ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ = Critical (blocks progress)
- ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ = Major (significant friction)
- ðŸ”¥ = Minor (annoying but manageable)

STEP 4: Find the gapsInformation gaps:
- What do they need to know but don't?

Tool gaps:
- What do they need to do but can't?

Support gaps:
- Where do they need help but don't get it?

Experience gaps:
- Where does experience not match expectations?

STEP 5: Identify opportunities

For each pain point:
- Quick win: [Easy fix, high impact]
- Major improvement: [Bigger effort, transforms experience]
- Delight moment: [Exceeds expectations]

STEP 6: Prioritize opportunitiesImpact Ã— Effort matrix:
- High impact, low effort = DO NOW
- High impact, high effort = ROADMAP
- Low impact, low effort = NICE TO HAVE
- Low impact, high effort = DON'T DO

STEP 7: Map to product decisions

Each insight should drive action:
- Feature to build
- Copy to change
- Flow to redesign
- Support to add
- Communication to improve

Now create a journey map adapted to the specific context provided. Don't force it into a rigid template - adjust based on what journey you're actually mapping.

## Example Journey Map Structure

(Adapt this based on the actual journey being mapped)

### Journey Overview

Journey: [Name]User: [Persona]Goal: [What success looks like]Research basis: [Interviews with X users, analytics from Y sessions, Z support tickets]

---

### The Journey Stages

Stage 1: [Name]What they do:
[Actions, decisions, interactions]

Touchpoints:
[Where they interact with you]

Needs:
[What they're trying to accomplish]

Emotions: [Happy/frustrated/confused - use whatever makes sense]

Pain points:
- ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Critical blocker]
- ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Major friction]

Opportunities:
[What could be better]

---

Stage 2: [Name]

[Same type of info, adapted to this stage]

---

[Continue for all stages in this specific journey]

---

### Key Insights

Biggest pain points:
1. [Pain point with stage and impact]
2. [Another]

Critical moments:
[Moments where users succeed or fail]

Emotional peaks/valleys:
[Where experience is great or terrible]

Drop-off points:
[Where users abandon journey]

---

### Prioritized Opportunities

QUICK WINS:
- [Opportunity 1]: [Why + expected impact]
- [Opportunity 2]

ROADMAP:
- [Bigger opportunity]: [Why + effort]

AVOID:
- [Thing not worth doing]: [Why not]

---

### Action Plan

[Specific next steps based on insights]
